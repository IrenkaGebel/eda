          I have long been a gatherer. Though we rarely hear this word used
          literally anymore, we do hear its sister gathering, as in gathering
          people, gathering information, gathering pace.
          Occasionally—increasingly, through a year of pandemic—we hear of
          gathering mushrooms and wild-foraged bouquets, hobbies for the
          otherwise domesticated. But the term gatherer we more immediately
          associate with our origins as hunter-gatherers, nomads foraging food
          and moving with the seasons for subsistence. We went, we gathered
          goods, and then we returned home to our kin, sharing as survival.
